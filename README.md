# Midipal (Fork)

Midipal, the MIDI swiss army knife (forked version).

This is a fork of these read-only repos:
- https://github.com/pichenettes/midipal
- https://github.com/pichenettes/avril
- https://github.com/pichenettes/avril-firmware_tools

The main goals of this fork:
- refresh codebase so that it compiles with my environment (WSL Ubuntu)
- extend original Midipal featuresfor my own (creative) need.

Note: I've unsubmoduled the main repo to simplify as everything is read-only for a while.
